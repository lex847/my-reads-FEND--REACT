# MyReads Project

This app keeps track of your book collection, as well as organizes them in a list of "Currently Reading," "Read," and "Want to Read."
The bottom right is the "Search" icon, which will bring you to a screen to search for additional titles you may want to put on your list as well.

In order to run the program, please:

1) Download to a directory
2) Navigate to that directory in your terminal
3) Type: 'npm install' to load any dependencies
4) Open "index.html" located in the "public" folder with your browser of choice
5) Enjoy!

Starter code was provided by the lovely folks over at Udacity.
